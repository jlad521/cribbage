Hello Professor Irwin,

To run the program:
./compile
./server runs the server; ./client runs the client

We have achieved the 20% bonus: you may close the client at ANY time, re-open it, 
and you will be at exactly the same game state you left at.

If the user wants to start a new game, simply type ./rst from the command line. 
This resets the database to a new game state.

I've set the game to end at 25 points, so you can quickly see all phases of gameplay

Cheers!
